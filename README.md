# MegaETH Faucet Tracker

A small project to track daily faucet claims and on-chain activity on the MegaETH testnet.  
Goal: understand throughput, latency, and faucet distribution patterns during the test phase.

## Current Idea
- Log daily faucet claim times (UTC)
- Fetch basic testnet explorer data (tx count, block times)
- Publish results in a simple JSON/CSV file
- Visualize evolution over time

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic claim logging
- [ ] Add explorer API connection
- [ ] Create a simple chart (Streamlit / Plotly)

I’m not a developer — this project is a learning notebook to explore MegaETH’s “real-time Ethereum” design.
